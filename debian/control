Description: A complete Modelica environment
 The goal of the project is to create a complete Modelica modeling, compilation
 and simulation environment based on free software distributed in binary and
 source code form.
 .
 This package is a Debian metapackage. After installation this package can be
 removed. This metapackage pulls in the following OpenModelica packages:
 .
 1. Package omc the OpenModelica Compiler/Interpreter (omc)
 2. Package omshell the OpenModelica Shell (OMShell)
 3. Package omshell-terminal the OpenModelica Shell-terminal (OMShell-terminal)
 4. Package omlib-msl32 the Modelica Standard Library version 3.2.1
 5. Package omnotebook the OpenModelica Notebook, with DrModelica and DrControl
 6. Package omedit, a Modelica connection editor for OpenModelica
 7. Package omoptim, a tool for optimization of Modelica models (temporarily removed while the build system is being updated)
 8. Package omplot, the plot tools for OpenModelica

Description: The OpenModelica Compiler
 This is the core of the OpenModelica project. It can be used stand-alone as
 a compiler. It is recommended to use it together with an OpenModelica client,
 such as OMShell (textual interface), OMNotebook (for teaching purposes)
 or OMEdit (graphical modeling).
